- You should be comfortable with basic programming concepts for javascript: variables, loops, conditions, functions, arrays
- Have a basic working knowledge of HTML and CSS 
- Know about the DOM
- Rather than passive learning, be active (play with the code, try to make changes and see what happens) (e.g. driving)
- Try not to re-invent the wheel (Someone probably has probably done it before)
